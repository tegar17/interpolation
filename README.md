# 📈 Interpolation Visualization Tool

A simple Python project to visualize interpolation on a graph in real-time using interactive mouse input.

---

## 📍 Background & Motivation

This project was created as part of my learning process in numerical methods and data visualization.

The main goal is to understand how interpolation works by applying it directly to a graph using user-defined points. By interacting with the plot, users can intuitively see how the interpolation curve changes when points are added or removed.

This project helps bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation in Python.
